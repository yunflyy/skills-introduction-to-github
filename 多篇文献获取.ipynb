      "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory vascular disease driven by traditional and nontraditional risk factors. Genome-wide association combined with clonal lineage tracing and clinical trials have demonstrated that innate and adaptive immune responses can promote or quell atherosclerosis. Several signaling pathways, that are associated with the inflammatory response, have been implicated within atherosclerosis such as NLRP3 inflammasome, toll-like receptors, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, Notch and Wnt signaling pathways, which are of importance for atherosclerosis development and regression. Targeting inflammatory pathways, especially the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and its regulated inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β, could represent an attractive new route for the treatment of atherosclerotic diseases. Herein, we summarize the knowledge on cellular participants and key inflammatory signaling pathways in atherosclerosis, and discuss the preclinical studies targeting these key pathways for atherosclerosis, the clinical trials that are going to target some of these processes, and the effects of quelling inflammation and atherosclerosis in the clinic.\n",

      "Atherosclerotic disease, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, is the number one killer worldwide. Atherosclerosis is considered to be caused by multiple factors, including genetic and environmental factors. In humans, it takes several decades until the clinical complications develop. There are many known risk factors for atherosclerosis, including hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes and smoking, which are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis; however, it is generally believed that atherosclerosis is vascular chronic inflammation initiated by interactions of these risk factors and arterial wall cells. In the past 30 years, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis have been investigated extensively using genetically modified animals, and lipid-reducing drugs, such as statins, have been demonstrated as the most effective for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. However, despite this progress, questions regarding the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remain and there is a need to develop new animal models and novel therapeutics to treat patients who cannot be effectively treated by statins. In this review, we will focus on two topics of atherosclerosis, \"pathology\" and \"pathogenesis,\" and discuss unanswered questions.\n",

      "Emerging evidence has spurred a considerable evolution of concepts relating to atherosclerosis, and has called into question many previous notions. Here I review this evidence, and discuss its implications for understanding of atherosclerosis. The risk of developing atherosclerosis is no longer concentrated in Western countries, and it is instead involved in the majority of deaths worldwide. Atherosclerosis now affects younger people, and more women and individuals from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds, than was formerly the case. The risk factor profile has shifted as levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, blood pressure and smoking have decreased. Recent research has challenged the protective effects of high-density lipoprotein, and now focuses on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in addition to low-density lipoprotein as causal in atherosclerosis. Non-traditional drivers of atherosclerosis-such as disturbed sleep, physical inactivity, the microbiome, air pollution and environmental stress-have also gained attention. Inflammatory pathways and leukocytes link traditional and emerging risk factors alike to the altered behaviour of arterial wall cells. Probing the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has highlighted the role of the bone marrow: somatic mutations in stem cells can cause clonal haematopoiesis, which represents a previously unrecognized but common and potent age-related contributor to the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Characterizations of the mechanisms that underpin thrombotic complications of atherosclerosis have evolved beyond the 'vulnerable plaque' concept. These advances in our understanding of the biology of atherosclerosis have opened avenues to therapeutic interventions that promise to improve the prevention and treatment of now-ubiquitous atherosclerotic diseases.\n",

      "The recognition of atherogenesis as an active process rather than a passive cholesterol storage disease has underlined key inflammatory mechanisms. Hence, innate and adaptive immune responses play an important role in the onset and progression of atherosclerosis. More recently, some clinical studies were designed to address the impact of anti-inflammatory intervention strategies in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease beyond the management of classic risk factors. Therefore, we review first the pathophysiological contribution of inflammation to atherosclerosis and the effect of lipid-lowering drugs on inflammatory biomarkers. Next, we address the effect of classic anti-inflammatory drugs, pharmacological therapies targeting specific inflammatory mediators and vaccines in cardiovascular prevention.\n",

      "This review aims at summarizing updated evidence on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk associated with consumption of specific food items to substantiate dietary strategies for atherosclerosis prevention. A systematic search on PubMed was performed to identify meta-analyses of cohort studies and RCTs with CVD outcomes. The evidence is highly concordant in showing that, for the healthy adult population, low consumption of salt and foods of animal origin, and increased intake of plant-based foods-whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts-are linked with reduced atherosclerosis risk. The same applies for the replacement of butter and other animal/tropical fats with olive oil and other unsaturated-fat-rich oil. Although the literature reviewed overall endorses scientific society dietary recommendations, some relevant novelties emerge. With regard to meat, new evidence differentiates processed and red meat-both associated with increased CVD risk-from poultry, showing a neutral relationship with CVD for moderate intakes. Moreover, the preferential use of low-fat dairies in the healthy population is not supported by recent data, since both full-fat and low-fat dairies, in moderate amounts and in the context of a balanced diet, are not associated with increased CVD risk; furthermore, small quantities of cheese and regular yogurt consumption are even linked with a protective effect. Among other animal protein sources, moderate fish consumption is also supported by the latest evidence, although there might be sustainability concerns. New data endorse the replacement of most high glycemic index (GI) foods with both whole grain and low GI cereal foods. As for beverages, low consumption not only of alcohol, but also of coffee and tea is associated with a reduced atherosclerosis risk while soft drinks show a direct relationship with CVD risk. This review provides evidence-based support for promoting appropriate food choices for atherosclerosis prevention in the general population.\n",

      "With the changing disease spectrum, atherosclerosis has become increasingly prevalent worldwide and the associated diseases have emerged as the leading cause of death. Due to their fascinating physical, chemical, and biological characteristics, nanomaterials are regarded as a promising tool to tackle enormous challenges in medicine. The emerging discipline of nanomedicine has filled a huge application gap in the atherosclerotic field, ushering a new generation of diagnosis and treatment strategies. Herein, based on the essential pathogenic contributors of atherogenesis, as well as the distinct composition/structural characteristics, synthesis strategies, and surface design of nanoplatforms, the three major application branches (nanodiagnosis, nanotherapy, and nanotheranostic) of nanomedicine in atherosclerosis are elaborated. Then, state-of-art studies containing a sequence of representative and significant achievements are summarized in detail with an emphasis on the intrinsic interaction/relationship between nanomedicines and atherosclerosis. Particularly, attention is paid to the biosafety of nanomedicines, which aims to pave the way for future clinical translation of this burgeoning field. Finally, this comprehensive review is concluded by proposing unresolved key scientific issues and sharing the vision and expectation for the future, fully elucidating the closed loop from atherogenesis to the application paradigm of nanomedicines for advancing the early achievement of clinical applications.\n",

When the resolution program fails, inflammation persists. It is now understood that failed resolution is a major underlying cause of many chronic inflammatory diseases. Here, we will review the major failures of resolution in atherosclerosis, including the imbalance of proinflammatory to pro-resolving mediator production, impaired clearance of dead cells, and functional changes in immune cells that favor ongoing inflammation. In addition, we will briefly discuss new concepts that are emerging as possible regulators of resolution and highlight the translational significance for the field.\n",

      "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, and it commonly results from atherosclerotic plaque progression. One of the increasingly recognized drivers of atherosclerosis is dysfunctional efferocytosis, a homeostatic mechanism responsible for the clearance of dead cells and the resolution of inflammation. In atherosclerosis, the capacity of phagocytes to participate in efferocytosis is hampered, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic and necrotic tissue within the plaque, which results in enlargement of the necrotic core, increased luminal stenosis and plaque inflammation, and predisposition to plaque rupture or erosion. In this Review, we describe the different forms of programmed cell death that can occur in the atherosclerotic plaque and highlight the efferocytic machinery that is normally implicated in cardiovascular physiology. We then discuss the mechanisms by which efferocytosis fails in atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases, including myocardial infarction and diabetes mellitus, and discuss therapeutic approaches that might reverse this pathological process.\n",

      "Cardiovascular diseases caused by atherosclerosis do not typically manifest before middle age; however, the disease process begins early in life. Preclinical atherosclerosis can be quantified with imaging methods in healthy populations long before clinical manifestations present. Cohort studies have shown that childhood exposure to risk factors, such as dyslipidaemia, elevated blood pressure and tobacco smoking, are associated with adult preclinical atherosclerotic phenotypes. Importantly, these long-term effects are substantially reduced if the individual becomes free from the risk factor by adulthood. As participants in the cohorts continue to age and clinical end points accrue, the strongest evidence linking exposure to risk factors in early life with cardiovascular outcomes has begun to emerge. Although science has deciphered the natural course of atherosclerosis, discovered its causal risk factors and developed effective means to intervene, we are still faced with an ongoing global pandemic of atherosclerotic diseases. In general, atherosclerosis goes undetected for too long, and preventive measures, if initiated at all, are inadequate and/or come too late. In this Review, we give an overview of the available literature suggesting the importance of initiating the prevention of atherosclerosis in early life and provide a summary of the major paediatric programmes for the prevention of atherosclerotic disease. We also highlight the limitations of current knowledge and indicate areas for future research.\n",

      "The development and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis are significantly influenced by lifestyle, particularly nutrition. The modern level of science and technology development promote personalized nutrition as an efficient preventive measure against atherosclerosis. In this survey, the factors were revealed that contribute to the formation of an individual approach to nutrition: genetic characteristics, the state of the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and environmental factors (diets, bioactive components, cardioprotectors, etc.). In the course of the work, it was found that in order to analyze the predisposition to atherosclerosis associated with nutrition, genetic features affecting the metabolism of nutrients are significant. The genetic features include the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of genes and epigenetic factors. The influence of telomere length on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and circadian rhythms was also considered. Relatively new is the study of the relationship between chrono-nutrition and the development of metabolic diseases. That is, to obtain the relationship between nutrition and atherosclerosis, a large number of genetic markers should be considered. In this relation, the question arises: \"How many genetic features need to be analyzed in order to form a personalized diet for the consumer?\" Basically, companies engaged in nutrigenetic research and choosing a diet for the prevention of a number of metabolic diseases use SNP analysis of genes that accounts for lipid metabolism, vitamins, the body's antioxidant defense system, taste characteristics, etc. There is no set number of genetic markers. The main diets effective against the development of atherosclerosis were considered, and the most popular were the ketogenic, Mediterranean, and DASH-diets. The advantage of these diets is the content of foods with a low amount of carbohydrates, a high amount of vegetables, fruits and berries, as well as foods rich in antioxidants. However, due to the restrictions associated with climatic, geographical, material features, these diets are not available for a number of consumers. The way out is the use of functional products, dietary supplements. In this approach, the promising biologically active substances (BAS) that exhibit anti-atherosclerotic potential are: baicalin, resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin and other plant metabolites. Among the substances, those of animal origin are popular: squalene, coenzyme Q10, omega-3. For the prevention of atherosclerosis through personalized nutrition, it is necessary to analyze the genetic characteristics (SNP) associated with the metabolism of nutrients, to assess the state of the microbiota of the GIT. Based on the data obtained and food preferences, as well as the individual capabilities of the consumer, the optimal diet can be selected. It is topical to exclude nutrients of which their excess consumption stimulates the occurrence and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and to enrich the diet with functional foods (FF), BAS containing the necessary anti-atherosclerotic, and stimulating microbiota of the GIT nutrients. Personalized nutrition is a topical preventive measure and there are a number of problems hindering the active use of this approach among consumers. The key factors include weak evidence of the influence of a number of genetic features, the high cost of the approach, and difficulties in the interpretation of the results. Eliminating these deficiencies will contribute to the maintenance of a healthy state of the population through nutrition.\n",
